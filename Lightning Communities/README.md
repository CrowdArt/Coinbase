# Lightning Communities Developer Guide
## Override Template Elements with Custom CSS
* Use the CSS Editor in Community Builder to add custom CSS that overrides the default template and Branding panel styles.
* You can also use it to make minor changes to the appearance of out-of-the-box components, such as padding adjustments.
* For large customizations, use the CSS resource in custom Lightning components and custom theme layout components instead of custom CSS.
