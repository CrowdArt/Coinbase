As a Coinbase UX Designer, I want the application owners tables to use my design guideline so that the application looks more presentable to users filling out applications.

Acceptance Criteria:

When a user is filling out an application and has to enter in details related to an owner, they see 2 different owners tables depending on the type of data requested:

Table 1 (Simple Owner table): https://balsamiq.cloud/s5p0e30/p3czu2u/rAB91

Table 2 (Simple 2 Owner table): https://balsamiq.cloud/s5p0e30/p3czu2u/rD8C2

Table 3 (Complex Owner table): https://balsamiq.cloud/s5p0e30/p3czu2u/r19B4

Within each table the user can:

Fill out all fields which save to the related/tagged Owner record in Salesforce

Click Plus (below the table):

Clicking plus adds the exact same table immediately below the previous table including all Field names/documents

It creates a new Owner record in Salesforce

Plus button continues to drop below each new Owner Table

Click Trash (within every table)

Clicking Trash deletes the table from the User to see

Clicking Trash also deletes the record from Salesforce

Within Table the field names appear above and within the entry boxes. 

When the user types they go away

When the user removes everything they reappear

Within the Table the user sees Headings
